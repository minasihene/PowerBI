# A Power BI report that compares the IU-Bloomington campus with selected Consortium/Big10 peer institutions for 2020
The process of creating a Power BI report contains iterative and intuitive processes that include data collection, preparation, visualization, and sharing, among others. Below, I outline the entire process of creating the IU-Bloomington Power BI report from start to finish:

Step 1: Data Gathering and Preparation
1. Identifying Data Sources: I identified the key data sources and datasets required for the report. I specifically accessed the Employees Assigned by Position, Finance, and Institutional Characteristics CSV data files hosted on the IPEDS website. These datasets and definitions were downloaded to my local machine.
2. Data Extraction and Transformation: I connected the CSV datasets using Power Query Editor in Power BI. Following that, I worked on data cleansing and transformation. My efforts included deduplication, filtering, data type change, the addition of calculated columns, and the usage of user-friendly column names based on data dictionary definitions.

Step 2: Data Modeling
1. Establishing Relationships: I created linkages between the different tables, resulting in a unified dataset ready for analysis and adhering to the star schema data model idea.
2. Measures and Calculated Columns: I created a set of metrics using the DAX language. These measures were mostly used to conditionally format card images on the Employee and Educational Offerings page.
Step 3: Data Visualization
1. Visualization Design: I selected visual types that were consistent with the report's broad objectives and analytical goals. The chosen visualizations expertly permitted comparisons across entities (selected campuses), effectively revealing data insights.

Step 4: Report Design
1. Layout and Formatting: In all my data analysis and visualization projects, I applied UI/UX principles to create visually appealing and user-friendly experiences, and this project was no exception. I used Figma to create a Power BI theme and page backgrounds with a color scheme that is consistent with IU-Bloomington's branding. In addition, I ensured that fonts were readable and conveyed a professional image.
In Power BI, I designed the layout of the report pages by carefully arranging visualizations on the canvas, ensuring consistent positioning, spacing, and whitespace. I used the formatting options to control colors, fonts, data labels, legends, titles, and styles to ensure a cohesive look and to provide context and clarity to visualizations.
2. Page Navigation: Given the presence of several report pages, each dedicated to a different aspect of analysis, I added page navigation buttons, ensuring user accessibility by allowing for transitions between distinct report pages.

By following these procedures, I was able to create an immersive and insightful Power BI report, utilizing data insights to inform IU-Bloomington's decision-making process.
